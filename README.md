# penrosetilingmap

A Unity 2021.3.2f1 project about generating game boards using Wave Function Collapse on Penrose tilings using the pentagrid method for constructing P3 Penrose tilings. 

Includes a graphical visualizer in editor for the pentagrid configuration and a Fibonacci heap for use as a priority queue.

Implementation of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm is not currently complete.
